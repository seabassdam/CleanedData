CleanedData

The script run_analysis.R downloads the data from :
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The script then clean the data by doing the following:

1) Merge training and test data sets.
2) Label merged data set
3) Extracts the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
4) Generate the CleanedData.txt that is a data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each volunteer.
